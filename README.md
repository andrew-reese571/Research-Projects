# Research-Projects Projects by Andrew Reese
This repository contains two  analysis projects that I have completed independently. Each of them showcase my skills in data exploration, applied analytical skills, and clear communication of results.

## Projects

### 1. **The Flight of a Golf Ball: A Physics-Based Predictive Model**

**Overview**  
This project explores the complex physics governing the flight of a golf ball and develops two predictive models to estimate carry distance based on launch conditions.

**Objectives**
- Build a numerical model to simulate golf ball trajectories including lift and drag forces.
- Derive a simplified equation for estimating carry distance using dimensional analysis.
- Compare predictions with TrackMan data used by PGA professionals.

**Key Features**
- Physics-based ODE modeling using Newtonian mechanics.
- Lift and drag modeled using realistic coefficients.
- Python implementation using `scipy.integrate` and `matplotlib` for simulations.
- Error analysis and comparison between full and simplified models.

**Technologies**  
Python, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Physics Modeling, Dimensional Analysis

**Outcome**  
- Created a model that predicts drive distances within ~10â€“15 yards of real TrackMan data.
- Simplified model offers quick, reasonable estimates under ideal conditions.


### 2. **Understanding the Impact of COVID-19 on the United States: A Time Series Analysis**

**Overview**  
A comprehensive time series analysis of monthly COVID-19 cases and deaths across the U.S. from January 2020 to April 2023, with a focus on identifying trends, seasonality, and policy impacts.

**Objectives**
- Determine the effects of government interventions (e.g., quarantines, mask mandates, vaccines).
- Analyze the correlation between new cases and deaths over time.
- Decompose the time series to assess seasonal and trend components.

**Key Features**
- Nationwide monthly aggregation from USAFacts COVID-19 datasets.
- Cross-correlation analysis between case and death counts.
- STL decomposition to separate trend, seasonality, and residual noise.
- Identification of variant-driven spikes and vaccination impacts.

**Technologies**  
R, ggplot2, ts analysis, STL decomposition

**Outcome**  
- Identified a 1-month lag between spikes in cases and corresponding deaths.
- Demonstrated clear seasonal patterns with spikes in winter months.
- Showed that vaccination efforts corresponded with a decline in COVID-19 fatalities.
